      {
        "Gardener": "Chris",
        "AnAnswer": "If you want it to produce a true coppice you need to start it at a very early age. You need to entice this young tree to start producing shoots lower down. You could go 2/3ft (60/90cm) above ground level and I would take a strip of the bark out, up to about a third of the way around the trunk. You could use a pruning knife to make two parallel lines 1cm apart and peel the bark out, you can do that quite early in the spring when the sap is rising, before the buds have broken. Once you have taken it out flip it 180 degrees, re-insert it and bind it with something like raffia. This will limit the movement of hormones up and down the plant and a bud could appear below the cut which will receive nutrients from the roots. Hopefully somewhere below the cut you will see new shoots starting to grow."

I would wait until the soil is warmer and plant up to the end of April or early May. You can start them in modules under glass and before the large tap root has formed.

        "Gardener": "Matthew",
        "AnAnswer": "They are thought of as woodland plants but they do require a lot of light. They often work well in a coppiced woodland. They like enriched woodland soil but they are tolerant of poorer conditions. Once settled in they will bulk out quite quickly."
      },
      {
        "Gardener": "Anne",
        "AnAnswer": "They do like good drainage as well as appreciating some moisture. You want to lift them after flowering when they are still green and be prepared to go fairly deep. You will need to plant them equally deep."

      {
        "Gardener": "James",
        "AnAnswer": "You will require a second plant. If it was due to the health of the plant you wouldn’t get any flowering. If you are short of space, you could use Sibley's Patio Quince."
