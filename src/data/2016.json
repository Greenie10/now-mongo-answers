You could go 2/3ft (60/90cm) above ground level and I would take a strip of the bark out, up to about a third of the way around the trunk. You could use a pruning knife to make two parallel lines 1cm apart and peel the bark out, you can do that quite early in the spring when the sap is rising, before the buds have broken. Once you have taken it out flip it 180 degrees, re-insert it and bind it with something like raffia. This will limit the movement of hormones up and down the plant and a bud could appear below the cut which will receive nutrients from the roots. Hopefully somewhere below the cut you will see new shoots starting to grow."
